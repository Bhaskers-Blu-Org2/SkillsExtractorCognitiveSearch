Join Microsoft’s Quantum Architecture and Computation team and work on the software that will be used to control quantum computers. You will join the team that is developing the software to acquire, store, secure, share, process and visualize data across the quantum program. You will work with physicists, hardware designers, software developers, and researchers to help make quantum computing a reality. Responsibilities This role is responsible for developing, deploying, maintaining and supporting several Azure services to serve the data needs of various facets of the quantum program. You will be part of a cross-functional distributed team with a broad range of skills. We work in a collaborative, agile, somewhat skunkworks fashion, and you will be expected to bring a can-do attitude, serious development skills, and a big-picture view to the team, so that you round out the team’s capabilities. You will need to have significant experience in developing production services for the cloud, first rate knowledge of Azure’s core capabilities, a good understanding of agile workflows and tools, and experience with dev-ops in a production environment. We work with WebApi, Microsoft Orleans, Cosmos DB, and Kubernetes on the back-end – you will ideally know these technologies, or least be extremely comfortable with all the concepts around scalable distributed computing, data storage and deployment. You will also need to have experience with modern JavaScript-based web interfaces – ideally with a modern framework like React; and have some experience with Electron applications. We use Azure DevOps for CI/CD and you will ideally be very comfortable with that. We program in C#, Python, Rust, F#, and C++ so bonus-points if you can tick off more than a two of those (and add some more!) Our team is globally distributed between Copenhagen, Delft, and Sydney. You will need to be willing to travel periodically to Europe or the US to have regular face-time with your teammates. Qualifications 8 or more years of programming experience5 or more years of .NET programming experience3 or more years of Cloud Computing (preferably Azure)Undergraduate degree or equivalent in computer science, engineering or mathematicsPrior experience with quantum computing or quantum physics isn’t required; this is a great opportunity for you to expand your knowledge and learn from some of the luminaries in these areas.
