### **This tutorial assumes you already have an instance of Azure Search running. See the documentation here to get started with Azure Search https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/**

If you're unfamiliar with Azure Search Cognitive Skills you can read more about them here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-concept-intro

## Prerequisites

Before running this sample, you must have the following:

* Install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest). This article requires the Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version you have.  
You can also use the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/bash).

* If you want to run the function locally install [Azure Function Core Tools version 2.x](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local#v2)


# Running the Function App locally

If you just want to skip this and just deploy the prebuilt container to an Azure Function skip to [Deploy Docker Container to Azure Functions using Azure CLI](#deploy-docker-container-to-azure-functions-using-azure-cli)

## Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/SkillsExtractorCognitiveSearch
```

## Start the Function

```
func host start
```

When the Functions host starts, it write something like the following output, which has been truncated for readability

```output

## Test the Function locally

Lets make sure we can process Azure Search Records as expected.
Run the following POST request to test your function locally.

```http
POST http://localhost:7071/api/extract_skills?skill_property=name
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json
{
    "values": [
        {
            "recordId": "a3",
            "data": {
                "text": "Azure Machine Learning team is a fast-paced product group within the Microsoft Artificial Intelligence & Research organization.

                "language": "en"
            }
        }
   ]
}
```

You should see a response that looks like this:

```json
{
    "values": [
        {
            "recordId": "a3",
            "data": {
                "skills": [
                    "Artificial intelligence",
                    "Azure Machine Learning",

                    "Computer science",
                    "Data science",
                    "Deep learning",
                    "Design",
                    "Engineering",
                    "Machine learning"
                ]
            },
            "errors": null,
            "warnings": null
        }
    ]
}
```

It looks like we missed one potential skill: **UX**
Let's add **UX** as a skill we want to extract.

## Add a new Skill

The main `data/skill_patterns.jsonl` file is built programatically from `data/skills.json`
so we won't edit it directly. Instead we're going to add any new patterns to `data/extra_skill_patterns.jsonl`

Open the `data/extra_skill_patterns.jsonl` file and the following lines.

```json
{"label":"SKILL|ux","pattern":[{"LOWER":"ux"}]}
{"label":"SKILL|ux","pattern":[{"LOWER":"user"}, {"LOWER":"experience"}]}
```

This pattern syntax is specific to SpaCy's rule based matching. If you want learn more about the pattern syntax the SpaCy Docs have a great User Guide here:

https://spacy.io/usage/rule-based-matching#entityruler

> JSONL (files like *.jsonl) is an extension of JSON where each new line is a separate JSON object

## Restart the Function and test your new patterns

End the running host process and start the Functions host again with

```
func host start
```

Run the same POST request as before to `http://localhost:7071/api/extract_skills?skill_property=name`

Your response should now have UX included in the list of skills like below:

```json
{
    "values": [
        {
            "recordId": "a3",
            "data": {
                "skills": [
                    "Artificial intelligence",
                    "Azure Machine Learning",
                    "Business",
                    "Computer science",
                    "Data science",
                    "Deep learning",
                    "Design",
                    "Engineering",
                    "Machine learning",
                    "UX"
                ]
            },
            "errors": null,
            "warnings": null
        }
    ]
}
```

## Build a Docker Image from the Dockerfile

In the root folder run the `docker build` command providing your Docker Hub user id, image name and tag name

For instance
```
docker build . -t <docker_id>/skills-extractor-cognitive-search:v1.0.0
```

## Push the built image to Docker Hub

You need to be logged in to push this image to Docker Hub

Docker Login
```
docker login -u <docker_id> -p <dockerhub_password>
```

Push your image to Docker Hub

For instance
```
docker push <docker_id>/skills-extractor-cognitive-search:v1.0.0
```

Next we'll deploy this container to Azure Functions using the Azure CLI


# Deploy Docker Container to Azure Functions using Azure CLI

The first step is deploy your own instance of the Skills Extractor Azure Function.
You can build and host the container yourself from this repo or use the prebuilt container on Docker Hub: `mcr.microsoft.com/wwllab/skills/skills-extractor-cognitive-search`

> For a more complete walktrhough of deploying Azure Functions, Follow instructions here: 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-function-linux-custom-image#create-a-resource-group

## Login with Azure CLI

```azurecli-interactive
az login
```

## Set an active subscription

```azurecli-interactive
az account set --subscription mySubscriptionIdOrName
```

## Create a resource group

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location westus
```

## Create an Azure Storage account

```azurecli-interactive
az storage account create --name <storage_name> --location westus --resource-group myResourceGroup --sku Standard_LRS
```

## Create an App Service Plan for Linux

```azurecli-interactive
az appservice plan create --name myAppServicePlan --resource-group myResourceGroup --sku B1 --is-linux
```

## Create and deploy the custom image

The function app hosts the execution of your functions. Create a function app from a Docker Hub image by using the az functionapp create command.

```azurecli-interactive
az functionapp create --name <app_name> --storage-account  <storage_name>  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
--plan myAppServicePlan --deployment-container-image-name mcr.microsoft.com/wwllab/skills/skills-extractor-cognitive-search
```

## Configure the function app

The function needs the connection string to connect to the default storage account. The following command will add the necessary `AzureWebJobsStorage` setting to your function application settings

```azurecli-interactive
storageConnectionString=$(az storage account show-connection-string --resource-group myResourceGroup --name <storage_name> --query connectionString --output tsv)

az functionapp config appsettings set --name <app_name> \
--resource-group myResourceGroup \
--settings AzureWebJobsDashboard=$storageConnectionString \
AzureWebJobsStorage=$storageConnectionString
```

> It can take up to 20 minutes (usually around 5) for your function app to deploy this Docker Image.

# Test your Azure Function. 

## Get the Function Url from the Azure Portal

Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to the function app you created to in the previous step.

    "values": [
        {
            "recordId": "a3",
            "data": {

            "errors": null,
            "warnings": null
        }
    ]
}
```

Now let's setup an indexer to add these extracted skills to your search index

# Create a new Cognitive Skill in Azure Search

> For the full documentation on integrating custom cognitive skills see:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-custom-skill-interface

## Add a `skills` field to your search index

Open your search index in the Azure Portal and add a new field with the name `skills`.
You can also update your search index using the Azure Search REST API docs here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-an-index

![Skills Field](media/skills_field.jpg)



## Get the Function Url from the Azure Portal

Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to the function app you created to in the previous step.

Click Get Function URL

![Click the Get Function Url Button](media/get_function_url_btn.jpg)

And copy the Function URL

![Click the Get Function Url Button](media/function_url.jpg)


## Create a new skillset in Azure Search that points to your function url

Change content `"source": "document/content"` to the attribute that has the most text in for each document in your search index. 

For Example: `"source": "document/description"` if you have a `description` attribute for each document in your search index.

```http
PUT https://[servicename].search.windows.net/skillsets/extractskills?api-version=2017-11-11-Preview
api-key: [admin key]
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json
{
    "skills": [
      ...,  
      {
        "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Skills.Custom.WebApiSkill",
        "description": "Extract skills from each document",
        "uri": "[Your function url here]",
        "batchSize": 100,
        "context": "/document",
        "inputs": [
          {
            "name": "text",
            "source": "/document/content"
          }
        ],
        "outputs": [
          {
            "name": "skills",
            "targetName": "skills"
          }
        ]
      }
  ]
}
```

## Create a new indexer to map the `skills` output field to a search index

```http
PUT https://[servicename].search.windows.net/indexers/[indexer name]?api-version=2017-11-11-Preview
api-key: [admin key]
Content-Type: application/json
```
```json
{
    "name": "myIndexer",
    "dataSourceName": "myDataSource",
    "targetIndexName": "myIndex",
    "skillsetName": "extractskills",
    "outputFieldMappings": [
        {
            "sourceFieldName": "/document/skills",
            "targetFieldName": "skills"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Check your search index and you should see a new skills array 


```http
PUT https://[servicename].search.windows.net/indexes/[indexer name]/docs?api-version=2017-11-11-Preview&search=machine learning
api-key: [admin key]
Content-Type: application/json
```
